**Cars Management** is a full-stack application designed to manage car sales, brands, accessories, and owners. Users can perform CRUD operations on cars, brands, owners, and accessories, with secure authentication and role-based permissions for admins.  

The application also includes **robust validation**, **centralized error handling**, and dynamic **frontend-backend integration**.

## 🚀 How to Access the Project

The production stack is hosted across:

- **Backend:** Render (https://cars-management-co0d.onrender.com) (hibernates on free tier)
- **Frontend:** Vercel (https://cars-management-drab.vercel.app)
- **Database:** Aiven MySQL (free tier)
- **Deployment practice:** Initially deployed on AWS for learning, but the final production setup uses Render + Vercel + Aiven to avoid costs.

### Steps to run locally

1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pitercoding/cars-management.git
cd cars-management
```
2. Backend:  
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
3. Frontend:  
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve
```
## 🏆 Motivation
As a Computer Science student, this project was created to **practice full-stack development** by building a realistic management system.

It allowed me to apply concepts in **Spring Boot, Angular, REST APIs, authentication, database modeling, frontend UI/UX, and cloud deployment**.

## 📚 Learning Points

During development, I strengthened skills in:

- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript, SCSS, MDB Angular UI Kit, routing, HTTP interceptors.
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT authentication, centralized exception handling.
- **Database:** MySQL, repository design, relationships.
- **Deployment & Cloud:** Experience deploying to AWS, then using Render (backend), Vercel (frontend), and Aiven (MySQL) for the final free-tier setup.
- **Testing & Validation:** Unit tests, code coverage with JaCoCo, frontend form validations.
